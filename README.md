## App flow

- Home Fragment: the user has to be connected to the internet so that the data from the API can be accessed. The home fragment shows a list of houses received from the APIâ€™s response. Upon click, the Details Fragment is shown which displays more information about the house. If there's no internet connection, an error will be displayed.

- Details Fragment: shows more information about the house that was clicked. A map view is also shown which shows the location of the house. Upon the click on the map, Google Maps app will open to start navigation to this house. A save button is also there so the user can save houses in the Saved Fragment.

- Saved Fragment: This fragment contains the houses which the user saved. The user doesn't need internet connection to display these houses and their information as these houses are saved into a local database using Room.
